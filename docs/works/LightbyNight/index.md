## Abstract
 Klanggestalten invites users to perceive and share moments of nature in new ways. With the app, they can record their own sounds — such as birdsong, rustling leaves, or rainfall. These personal sound moments can be saved, adjusted, and played back.

The app, developed in Flutter, connects automatically via Bluetooth to the Klanggestalten Lamp, which is powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. Inside the lamp, three LED rings visualize the audio from the app. The sounds are separated into treble, mid, and bass frequencies and displayed as a dynamic light animation.

By touching the body of the lamp, users can physically feel the recordings in the form of vibrations. Both this haptic feedback and the live audio visualization can be individually switched on or off.

The sculptural body of the lamp was 3D-printed and houses all hardware components. Thanks to a simple plug-in system, all parts can be easily assembled and disassembled. The logo and all graphics for the project were also designed by the artist.

Inspired by nature, Klanggestalten acts as a bridge between the outside world and indoor spaces. It aims to foster inclusion by making acoustic experiences accessible across different senses
