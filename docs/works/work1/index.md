# We can't imagine how it has been, but they have existed.

## Abstract
 We can't imagine how it has been, but they have existed is an exploration of the cyclical relationship between ritual, memory, absence, imagination and the act of listening. At its core lies a self-built sound-object inspired by the rainstick — an instrument and ritual object that is made from a tube of cactus or bamboo, with many nails inside the walls and filled with seeds or small stones. By turning it, the seeds start falling through the nails - creating a soft sound like rain.​  
The project is not a rainsick, but inspired by it's elements it aims at creating a new kind of ritual (object) – reimagining the cycle of falling seeds as a practice of remembrance. ​Seeds, stones and rain carry memories of countless places. They invoke fragments of lost narratives and destroyed worlds. The project seeks to engage with the silenced and subjugated knowledges that linger as echoes—ghosts within the present. Rather than filling the gaps of historical records, the work invites into a practice of speculative listening and remembering – trying to create a ritual space in which lost fragments of the past might be sensed rather than told.

The project is guided by the following questions:
- Whose perspectives and archives shape our memories?
- How can we remember what was never archived?
- Can Art be a tool to unearth stories that were suppressed, altered, or banned?

## Motivation
We can not imagine how it has been, but it has existed.  
Memories of the past are mirroring a process of selection, shaped by the values of those in power to decide which events, communities, or practices are worth to be remembered. But how to remember what was left undocumented? How to recognize and value the lives and knowledges, that have been buried under dominating narratives and imaginaries? How to listen?

The subjugated knowledges – as described by foucault and many postcolonial thinkers – might open a path for new or different ways of remembering. But they live on as ghosts – coming back to us as fragments, distortions and a continuous but indecipherable murmuring.  
The project wants to create a ritual space in which listening might become a practice of remembering what we can not imagine. The materials and sounds become the medium of memory – witnesses of what refuses to be forgotten. Stones have existed and travelled for millions of years and also seeds and raindrops carry the fragments of endless cycles of disappearing and reappearing life.

## Historical Background
There is a story from one of the driest regions in the world, where people sought to call the rain with a long hollow stick from a dried-up cactus. They filled it with small seeds or stones and sealed it at both ends. When they slowly turned the stick, the sound was reminiscent of the much needed rain.  
Maybe the origins of the instrument lie in the Atacama desert in northern Chile and Argentina. There are numerous fragments of stories about the origins of what is today known as a rainstick - maybe only the seeds inside carry the memory of what was forgotten, suppressed or altered.

Instead of relying on written histories, the project aims at allowing surviving fragments of the past to call the ghosts, who are living on in the cracks and gaps of history. The ghosts are those elements of the past, which keep haunting our present by claiming to be recognized.

## Theoretical Context
Unable to bring back or tell their stories, what we can do is to imagine possible worlds, in which those lives who have been turned invisible can reappear in a dignified way. This approach is inspired by Saidiya Hartman’s method of critical fabulation. In her work on lives omitted from the historical record, Hartman proposes a form of speculative fiction that addresses the archival gaps by describing “what could have been”.

This form of imaginative fiction does not aim at filling the gaps, but rather tries to listen to what might come out of their depth and “attempts to say that which resists being said”.

The project wants to open a space for reflection and imagination – not by writing new fictions – but inviting into a practice of speculative listening and remembering. When the seeds and other fragments are moving in a nonstop cycle of raising and falling, listening might become a ritual and intimate encounter with what cannot be imagined, yet resists being forgotten.

## Planned Outcome / Output Format
The instrument will be crafted from various resonant woods and shaped like a rotating drum, creating a continuous cycle of falling and rising. Inside, it will hold many kinds of seeds — each carrying its own texture, sound, and memory.
